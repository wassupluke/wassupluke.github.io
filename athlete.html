<h1>Sport and fitness resources</h1>
</header>
<h2>My Primary Resources</h2>
<p>I use these for all my activities.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/503042">Strava</a></h3>
<p>A social activity tracking app that lets you view and share fitness file data from your trackers with friends.<br />
I personally use this for tracking my performance on different "segments" of road for my runs and bike rides.</p>
<h3><a href="https://intervals.icu/athlete/i75079/">Intervals.icu</a></h3>
<p>From the site, "Intervals.icu analyzes your rides, runs, swims and other activities.It provides basic and advanced analytics and planning in an easy to use web interface with support for desktops, phones and tablets. Follow your friends and help them progress, track your FTP without doing tests, coach other athletes, communicate with the built in chat, build a workout library and plan your training!"</p>
<p>I do all my data analysis and training/race performance evaluations with this site.<br />
This is also where I do my coaching for athletes.</p>
<p>Heavily customizable but has a fairly steep learning curve.</p>
<h2>Indoor / Off-Season Training</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.zwift.com/why-zwift">Zwift</a></h3>
<p>Zwift is my go-to indoor training solution for cycling in the off-season or during bad weather.<br />
It has tons of route options with beautiful scenery.<br />
If you use it with a resistance trainer like I do, you'll be able to "feel" the hills and descents while you ride, too!</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/12/elite-suito-trainer-review.html">Elite Suito</a></h3>
<p>The trainer I've used since getting into Zwift during C0v!d.<br />
If I were to buy something today, I'd likely get the <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/07/jetblack-victory-trainer.html">JetBlack Victory</a> trainer.</p>
<h3><a href="https://zwifterbikes.web.app/">ZwifterBikes</a></h3>
<p>Never wonder which frame-wheel combo is fastest on a given Zwift route ever again.</p>
<h3><a href="https://zwiftpower.com/">ZwiftPower</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/">ProCyclingStats</a> of Zwift.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.zwiftracing.app">ZwiftRacing</a></h3>
<p>Another site for Zwift race rankings and leaderboards with a virtual "ELO" (vELO) ranking that will be more familiar for video gamers.<br />
Gives information on your racer "Phenotype", has achievements to unlock, and shows your terrain handicaps.</p>
<h2>For Device / Product Reviews</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/">DC Rainmaker</a></h3>
<p>The guy goes stupid nerdy on all the data points and metric comparisons like I do, it's like he reads my mind and spits out exactly what I wanted to know about, say, a Garmin watch vs a Coros watch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I consider <strong>Intervals.icu</strong>, <strong>DC Rainmaker</strong>, and <strong>GP Llama</strong> to be the <em>trifecta</em> of fitness equipment comparison and analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gplama">GP Llama</a></h3>
<p>Most of his content I get from YouTube and is another resource I use when looking at the performance of new sport/fitness tech.</p>
