			<h1>Main: BBQ Chicken Meatballs</h1>
			<i>4 servings | Eating Bird Food</i>
<div class="polaroid">
				<img src=https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bbq-chicken-meatballs-hero-new.jpg alt="BBQ Chicken Meatballs from eatingbirdfood.com" />
			</div>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 lb ground chicken</li>
				<li>¼ cup Japanese BBQ Sauce (I used Bachan's, plus more for topping)</li>
				<li>1 large egg</li>
				<li>¼ cup diced yellow onion (or green onion, white part only)</li>
				<li>⅓ cup (52 grams) packed almond flour (or ¼ cup panko breadcrumbs)</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
				<li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat for easy cleanup and to prevent sticking.
Mix
In a large mixing bowl, add the ground chicken, ¼ cup Japanese BBQ sauce, egg, diced onion, almond flour (or panko), garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix everything together using a large spoon or your hands until just combined. Don’t overmix, or the meatballs may turn out tough.
Scoop
Using a cookie scoop or spoon, scoop the mixture and roll into evenly sized meatballs (about 1½ tablespoons each). If the mixture is sticky, wet your hands slightly with water — this makes rolling much easier.
Bake
Place the meatballs on the prepared baking sheet, making sure they’re evenly spaced. Bake for 16–18 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through and reach an internal temperature of 165°F.
Toss
Remove from the oven and toss the warm meatballs in additional BBQ sauce to coat.
Serve immediately while warm with your favorite sides, as an appetizer, or store for later!</p>

			</div>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 lb brussels sprouts (ends cut off)</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
				<li>3/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
				<li>3/4 cup raw cashews</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>

				<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
				<li>3/4 tsp garlic powder or 3 cloves garlic (chopped and lightly sautéed)</li>
				<li>3/4 tsp sea salt</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>Preheat your oven to 425°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
To soften the brussels sprouts, you can use the microwave or stovetop. For the microwave, add the brussels sprouts to a large microwavable bowl and add water. Cover the bowl with a plate and microwave for 5 minutes on high heat, then drain and immediately rinse under cold water.
For the stovetop, boil salted water and then add Brussels sprouts. Cook for about 10 minutes to soften, then drain and rinse immediately under cold water.
Dry with paper towels and place the brussels sprouts on a baking sheet. Use the flat part of a glass to gently smash each one to flatten.
Combine the seasonings in a small bowl. Drizzle the sprouts with olive oil and sprinkle with the seasoning mixture.
Roast in the preheated oven for 15-18 minutes or until golden and crispy.
While the sprouts roast, make the dipping sauce.* Add all ingredients to a high speed blender and blend until smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape the sides as necessary.
Serve the Brussels sprouts with the dip and enjoy!</p>

			</div>

				<li>2 cups grapes, halved</li>

Cut and prep all the vegetables and fruits. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut into bite sized pieces. Place the salad ingredients in a large bowl – you can either arrange the bowl by ingredient, like pictured, or toss everything together. Refrigerate to chill.
For the dressing, puree all the dressing ingredients in a food processor until smooth. Taste and adjust to your preferences. Pour dressing over salad and serve.</p>

			</ul>
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>Gather and prep all ingredients and set the oven to 375°F.
Cook the lasagna noodles in salted water until just tender. Drain and lay flat on parchment paper lightly drizzled with oil to prevent sticking.
Sauté
In a large skillet, melt 1 Tbsp butter over medium heat. Sauté onion, celery, and garlic for 5-6 minutes, until softened. Stir in shrimp, imitation crab, spinach, lemon juice, and Cajun seasoning. Cook just until the shrimp turn pink and are cooked through. Remove from heat.
Combine
In a small bowl, stir together cottage cheese and parsley. Set aside.
Whisk
In a medium saucepan, melt ¼ cup butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute.
Cook
Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until thickened, about 5-6 minutes.
Mix
Stir in Parmesan and Old Bay seasoning. The sauce should be silky and pourable.***
Layer
Grease a 9x13 baking dish. Spread a thin layer of white sauce on the bottom. Layer 3 noodles slightly overlapping, half of the seafood filling, dollops of cottage cheese mixture, ⅓ of the white sauce, and a sprinkle of mozzarella. Repeat the layers once more. Finish with the last 3 noodles, the remaining sauce, and the rest of the mozzarella.
Bake
Cover tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 15-20 minutes. Broil on high for 3-5 minutes, until the cheese is golden.
Serve
Let the seafood lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Garnish with any leftover fresh parsley and enjoy.</p>
