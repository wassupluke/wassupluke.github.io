The models are extremely beneficial for planning the operation procedure as well as for helping the patient better understand the surgery. Pioneered a project prototyping for thoracic facet joint injection and epidurals, created the Anatomic Modeling Unit’s first dental educational model from a Panorex scan for residency students, and designed an educational foot model. Roughly 15 hours a week.

Learned how to transfer data from the recording software to Excel for organization and analysis of the data. Learned how to generate statistical comparisons using two way repeated-measures ANOVA and paired t-tests. Attended weekly (or more frequently, depending on the week) seminars and grand rounds to sit in and learn about the growing research fields. Roughly 50 hours a week.
