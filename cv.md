The models are extremely beneficial for planning the operation procedure as well as for helping the patient better understand the surgery. Pioneered a project prototyping for thoracic facet joint injection and epidurals, created the Anatomic Modeling Unit’s first dental educational model from a Panorex scan for residency students, and designed an educational foot model. Roughly 15 hours a week.

`2013` **Human Integrative Physiology Laboratory** *Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN*

Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF Program)

**Dr. Joyner, Principal Investigator**

> Studied the effect of inhibiting the carotid bodies in humans with dopamine on blood glucose regulation during prolonged exercise in Dr. Michael Joyner’s Human Integrative Physiology Laboratory. Gained technical skills by assisting with experimental setup for the project as well as setup for other studies. Read protocols and other information for the study and some of the others as well. Assisted with carrying out the studies, including manually recording specific study variables, monitoring and working with study equipment, and interacting with the subject and the others helping to run the study. Learned how to transfer data from the recording software to Excel for organization and analysis of the data. Learned how to generate statistical comparisons using two way repeated-measures ANOVA and paired t-tests. Attended weekly (or more frequently, depending on the week) seminars and grand rounds to sit in and learn about the growing research fields. Roughly 50 hours a week.
